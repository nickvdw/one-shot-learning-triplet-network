# One-shot learning using a Triplet Network

In the notebook, we define a triplet Network for use with the Omniglot dataset. We introduce the triplet loss, propose two methods of triplet selection (based on random and hard triplets), and we evaluate one-shot learning with the random and hard triplet selection methods. Furthermore, we compare these two methods against each other and discuss how one should pick a margin.
